### Contact App 

Simple contact storing webapp by the use of ReactJS and localstorage to store contacts data. This is a good example if you want too start with react js and to clear the concept about it. This also include use of React-Final-Form to handle form submission and real time validation. On to the UI part I have try to go for glassmorphism which is the latest trend now a days.

Below are some screenshots.
